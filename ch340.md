Disable service
The BRLTTY service is launched by the brltty.path service. This service can be completely prevented from ever starting by running by doing the following:

```code
sudo systemctl mask brltty.path
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/brltty.path â†’ /dev/null.
```

Reconect usb-device (ESP32) derefter.
